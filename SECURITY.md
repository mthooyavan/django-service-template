# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Issue

We value the security community and believe that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of all our users.

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, please report it to us. We welcome working with you to resolve the issue promptly.

### Disclosure Policy

- Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue.
- Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third-party.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.

### Exclusions

While researching, we'd like to ask you to refrain from:

- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- Spamming
- Social Engineering (including phishing) of our staff or contractors

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security concern, please email us at security@thooyavan.me. We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will strive to keep you informed about our progress towards a fix and full announcement.

If you report a vulnerability through our dedicated reporting channels, we will coordinate the disclosure process with you. In all cases, please:

- Your email should include detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability. This includes test scripts, screenshots, and/or screen recordings if possible. The more detailed and specific, the faster we can triage and fix.
- Your email should also include the impact of the vulnerability and any potential remediation you would suggest.

## Safe Harbor

Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct and we will not initiate legal action against you. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in connection with activities conducted under this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.

Thank you for helping keep our project and our users safe!
